-- charybdis-2.0.2

- Fix crashes when there is a hostname (instead of an IP address) in
  a connect{} block.
- Fix a crash related to exiting unknown clients.
- Move a dnsbl debugging notice from +s to +d.

-- charybdis-2.0.1

- Comment out blacklist{} block in example confs, as AHBL requires
  notification before use.
- Fix some bugs relating to the resolver.

-- charybdis-2.0.0

- Replace ADNS with a new smaller resolver from ircu and hybrid.
- Make services shortcuts (/chanserv etc) configurable in ircd.conf.
- Add extban: extensible +bqeI matching via modules. Syntax is
  $<type>[:<data>]. By default no modules are loaded.
- Add DNS blacklist checking.
- Change operator{} block user@host from host to orighost. This means that
  services/+h spoofs do not work in operator{} blocks; auth{} spoofs still
  work. Check your operator{} blocks!
- Split contrib/ into extensions/ and unsupported/.
- Change CHGHOST do show the change to all other clients on common channels
  with quit/join/mode.
- Add /rehash nickdelay to clear out the nickdelay tables.
- Glines are now disabled in the example confs.
- Show more error messages on stderr.
- Add OMODE command to extensions/ for easier oper mode hacking.
- Add HURT system to extensions/; this shuns clients matching certain host/ip
  unless and until they identify to services. Mainly intended for SorceryNet.
- Show SASL success and failure counts in /stats t.
- Allow more frequent autoconnects to servers.
- Messaging services by nickname no longer uses target change slots.
- Only accept SASL from servers in a service{} block.
- New auth{} flag need_sasl to reject users who haven't done SASL
  authentication.
- Expand blah.blah and blah:blah to *!*@... instead of ...!*@* for bans
- Don't allow opers to fake locops/operwall to +w.
- Documentation updates.
- Many bugfixes.

-- charybdis-1.1.0

- Use IsOperAdmin() instead of IsAdmin() when sending admin-only messages,
  that way hidden admins get them too.

  received.
