      <title>Meanings of cmodes</title>
      <sect2>
	<title>+b, channel ban</title>
	<para>
	  Bans take one parameter, either in the form +b nick!user@host.
	  The wildcards * and ? are allowed, matching zero-or-more, and
	  exactly-one characters respectively. The masks will be trimmed to fit the maximum allowable
	  length for the relevant element, with wildcards added as appropriate to ensure that they still
	  match.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+c, colour filter</title>
	<para>
	  This cmode activates the colour filter for the channel. This filters out bold, underline,
	  reverse video, beeps, mIRC colour codes, and ANSI escapes. Note that escape sequences will
	  usually leave cruft sent to the channel, just without the escape characters themselves.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+e, ban exemption</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes on parameter of the form nick!user@host, with the usual wildcards, which
	  overrides +b and +q bans for all clients it matches.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+f, channel forwarding</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes one parameter, the name of a channel (+f #channel). If the channel also has the
	  +i cmode set, and somebody attempts to join without either being expliticly invited, or having
	  an invex (+I), then they will instead join the channel named in the mode parameter. The client
	  will also be sent a 470 numeric giving the original and target channels.
	</para>
        <para>
          Users are similarly forwarded if the +j cmode is set and their attempt to join is throttled, or
          if +r is set and they are not identified.
        </para>
        <para>
          Forwards may only be set to +F channels, or to channels the setter
          has ops in.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+F, allow anybody to forward to this</title>
	<para>
	  When this mode is set, anybody may set a forward from a channel
	  they have ops in to this channel. Otherwise they have to have ops
	  in this channel.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+g, allow anybody to invite</title>
	<para>
	  When this mode is set, anybody may use the INVITE command on the channel in question. When it
	  is unset, only channel operators may use the INVITE command.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When this mode is set together with +i, all channel members can influence who can join.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+i, invite only</title>
	<para>
	  When this cmode is set, no client can join the channel unless they have an invex (+I) or are
	  invited with the INVITE command.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+I, invite exception (invex)</title>
	<para>
	  This mode takes a parameter of the form nick!user@host with the usual wildcards. Matching
	  clients do not need to be invited to join the channel when it is invite-only (+i).
	  They may also join the channel if it is +r even though they are not
	  identified, or if it is +J and too many users have joined recently.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+j, join throttling</title>
        <para>
          This mode takes one parameter of the form "n:t", where n and t are positive integers. Only n users may join in each period of t seconds.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+k, key (channel password)</title>
	<para>
	  Taking one parameter, when set, this mode requires a user to supply the key in order to join
	  the channel: /JOIN #channel key.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+l, channel member limit</title>
	<para>
	  Takes one numeric parameter, the number of users which are allowed to be in the channel before
	  further joins are blocked.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+L, large ban list</title>
	<para>
	  Channels with this mode will be allowed larger banlists (by default,
          500 instead of 50 entries for +b, +q, +e and +I together).
	  Only network operators may set this mode.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+m, moderated</title>
	<para>
	  When a channel is set +m, only users with +o or +v on the channel can send to it.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+n, prevent external send to channel</title>
	<para>
	  When set, this mode prevents users from sending to the channel without being in it themselves.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+p, paranoid channel</title>
	<para>
	  When set, the KNOCK command cannot be used on the channel
	  to request an invite, and users will not be shown the
	  channel in WHOIS replies unless they are on it.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+P, permanent channel</title>
	<para>
	  Channels with this mode (which is accessible only to network operators) set will not be destroyed
	  when the last user leaves.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+q, quiet</title>
	<para>
	  This mode behaves exactly like the simple form of +b (ban), except that the user may still join
	  the channel. The net effect is that they cannot send to the channel.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+Q, block forwarded users</title>
        <para>
          Channels with this mode set are not valid targets for forwarding. Any attempt to forward to
          this channel will be ignored, and the user will be handled as if the attempt was ever made (by
          sending them the relevant error message).
        </para>
        <para>
          This does not affect the ability to set +f.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+r, block unidentified</title>
        <para>
          When set, this mode prevents unidentified users from joining.
        </para>
      </sect2>
      <!-- not planned (jilles)
      <sect2>
        <title>+R, quiet unidentified</title>
        <para>
          When set, this mode prevents unidentified users from sending to the channel, although they can
          still join.
        </para>
	<para>
	  Please note that this mode is not implemented in Charybdis 1.0.x, and is documented in
	  expectation for upcoming Charybdis 1.1.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      -->
      <sect2>
	<title>+s, secret channel</title>
	<para>
	  When set, this mode prevents the channel from appearing in the
	  output of the LIST, WHO and WHOIS command by users who are not on
	  it. Also, the server will refuse to answer WHO, NAMES, TOPIC and
	  LIST queries from users not on the channel.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
        <title>+z, reduced moderation</title>
        <para>
          When +z is set, the effects of +m are relaxed. For each message, if that message
          would normally be blocked by moderation, it is instead sent to all the users who are
          currently set +o. This is intended for use in moderated debates.
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that +n and channel bans/quiets are unaffected by this. To silence a given user completely,
	  remove them from the channel.
        </para>
