      <sect2>
	<title>+a, server administrator</title>
	<para>
	  This vanity usermode is used to denote a server administrator in WHOIS output.
	  All local "admin" privileges are independent of it, though services
	  packages may grant extra privileges to +a users.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+g, Caller ID</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  Users with the +g umode set will only receive private messages from users on a
	  session-defined whitelist, defined by the /accept command. If the user is not
	  on a whitelist, then the target user will receive a rate-limited notice saying that the user
	  wishes to speak to them.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Network operators are not affected by the callerid whitelist system in the event
	  that they need to speak to users who have it enabled.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+i, invisible</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  Invisible users do not show up in WHO and NAMES unless you can see them.
	</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
	<title>+I, refuse invite</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  If you have the +I umode set, nobody will be able to issue an INVITE to let you
	  in to a channel.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This mode is not yet implemented. It will be implemented in Charybdis 1.1.
	</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>+l, receive locops</title>
	<para>
	  LOCOPS is a version of OPERWALL that is sent to opers on a single
	  server only. With cluster{} and shared{} blocks they can optionally
	  be propagated further.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Unlike OPERWALL, any oper can send and receive LOCOPS.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+o, operator</title>
	<para>
	  This indicates global operator status.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+Q, block forwarding</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
          This umode prevents you from being affected by any of the channel forwarding mechanisms. In
          any event where you would normally be forwarded, instead you will get the usual error message
          as if no forwarding was in effect.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+R, reject messages from unauthenticated users</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  If a user has the +R umode set, then any users who are not authenticated
	  will receive an error message if they attempt to send a private
	  message or notice to the +R user.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Opers and accepted users (like in +g) are exempt.
	  Unlike +g, the target user is not notified of failed messages.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+s, server notices</title>
	<para>
	  This umode allows an oper to receive server notices.
	  The requested types of server notices are specified as a
	  parameter (<quote>snomask</quote>) to this umode.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+S, network service</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This umode can only be set by servers named in a service{}
	      block.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  This umode grants various features useful for services. For example,
	  clients with this umode cannot be kicked or deopped on channels,
	  do not show channels the querying user is not on in WHOIS,
	  and do not appear in /stats p.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The exact effects of this umode are variable; no user or oper on
	  an actual charybdis server can set it.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+w, receive wallops</title>
	<para>
	  <note>
	    <para>
	      This is a user umode, which anybody can set. It is not specific to operators.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	  Users with the +w umode set will receive WALLOPS messages sent by opers.
	  Opers with +w additionally receive WALLOPS sent by servers (e.g.
	  remote CONNECT, remote SQUIT, many services packages).
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+z, receive operwall</title>
	<para>
	  OPERWALL differs from WALLOPS in that the ability to receive such messages is
	  restricted. Opers with +z set will receive OPERWALL messages.
	</para>
      </sect2>
