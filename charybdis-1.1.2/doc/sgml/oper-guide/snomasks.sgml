      <cmdsynopsis><command>MODE</command> 
	<arg choice=plain><replaceable>nick</replaceable></arg> 
	<arg choice=plain>+s</arg>
	<arg choice=plain><replaceable>+/-flags</replaceable></arg>
      </cmdsynopsis>
      <para>
	To set snomasks.

      <cmdsynopsis><command>MODE</command> 
	<arg choice=plain><replaceable>nick</replaceable></arg> 
	<arg choice=plain>-s</arg>
      </cmdsynopsis>
      <para>
	To clear all snomasks.
      </para>
      <para>
	Umode +s will be set if at least one snomask is set.
      </para>
      <para>
	Umode +s is oper only by default, but even if you allow nonopers to
	set it, they will not get any server notices.
      </para>

      <title>Meanings of server notice masks</title>
      <sect2>
	<title>+b, bot warnings</title>
	<para>
	  Opers with the +b snomask set will receive warning messages from the server when potential
	  flooders and spambots are detected.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+c, client connections</title>
	<para>
	  Opers who have the +c snomask set will receive server notices when clients attach to the
	  local server.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+C, extended client connection notices</title>
	<para>
	  Opers who have the +C snomask set will receive server notices when clients attach to the
	  local server. Unlike the +c snomask, the information is displayed in a format intended
	  to be parsed by scripts, and includes the two unused fields of the USER command.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+d, debug</title>
	<para>
	  The +d snomask provides opers extra information which may be of interest to debuggers.
	  It will also cause the user to receive server notices if certain assertions fail inside the
	  server. Its precise meaning is variable. Do not depend on the
	  effects of this snomask as they can and will change without notice in later revisions.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+f, full warning</title>
	<para>
	  Opers with the +f snomask set will receive notices when a user
	  connection is denied because a connection limit is exceeded
	  (one of the limits in a class{} block, or the total per-server
	  limit settable with /quote set max).
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+k, server kill notices</title>
	<para>
	  Opers with the +k snomask set will receive server notices when
	  other servers kill and save (forced nick change to UID) users.
	  Kills and saves by this server are on +d or +s.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+n, nick change notices</title>
	<para>
	  An oper with +n set will receive a server notice every time a local user changes their nick,
	  giving the old and new nicks.
	  This is mostly useful for bots that track all users on a single server.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+r, notices on name rejections</title>
	<para>
	  Opers with this snomask set will receive a server notice when somebody tries to use an
	  invalid username, or if a dumb HTTP proxy tries to connect.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+s, generic server notices</title>
	<para>
	  This snomask allows an oper to receive generic server notices.
	  This includes oper kills.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+u, unauthorized connections</title>
	<para>
	  This snomask allows an oper to see when users try to connect who do not have an
	  available auth{} block.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+x, extra routing notices</title>
	<para>
	  Opers who have the +x snomask set will get notices about servers
	  connecting and disconnecting on the whole network. This includes
	  all servers connected behind the affected link. This can get
	  rather noisy but is useful for keeping track of all linked
	  servers.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+y, spy</title>
	<para>
	  Opers with +y receive notices when users try to join RESV'ed (<quote>juped</quote>) channels. 
	  Additionally, if certain contrib modules are loaded, they will
	  receive notices when special commands are used and/or when they
	  are whoised.
	</para>
      </sect2>
      <sect2>
	<title>+Z, operspy notices</title>
	<para>
	  Opers with +Z receive notices whenever an oper anywhere on the
	  network uses operspy.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This snomask can be configured to be only effective for admins.
	</para>
